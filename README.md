## Key Architecture Points

### Workspace + SPM Structure
- **App Shell**: `lfm2onios/` contains minimal app lifecycle code
- **Feature Code**: `lfm2oniosPackage/Sources/lfm2oniosFeature/` is where most development happens
- **Separation**: Business logic lives in the SPM package, app target just imports and displays it

### Buildable Folders (Xcode 16)
- Files added to the filesystem automatically appear in Xcode
- No need to manually add files to project targets
- Reduces project file conflicts in teams

## Getting Started for New Engineers

### Quick Setup
1. **Prerequisites**: Xcode 15+, iOS 17.2+ simulator, macOS 13+
2. **Open Project**: `lfm2onios.xcworkspace` (NOT the `.xcodeproj` file)
3. **Build & Run**: Select "lfm2onios" scheme, choose iPhone 16 simulator, press ‚åòR
4. **First Launch**: App will show model selection - tap "Download" on LFM2 350M model

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Build and test
xcodebuild -workspace lfm2onios.xcworkspace -scheme lfm2onios -destination 'name=iPhone 16' build test

# Or use XcodeBuildMCP tools for AI-assisted development
# See CLAUDE.md for XcodeBuildMCP command reference
```

### Key Files for New Engineers
- **Entry Point**: `lfm2onios/lfm2oniosApp.swift` - App lifecycle and automation hooks
- **Main View**: `lfm2oniosPackage/Sources/lfm2oniosFeature/ContentView.swift` - Root SwiftUI view
- **Chat Interface**: Same file, `ChatView` struct - Main chat UI with model integration
- **Settings**: `SettingsView.swift` - Model management interface
- **Services**: All `*Service.swift` files - Core business logic (download, storage, runtime, persistence)
- **Tests**: `lfm2oniosPackage/Tests/lfm2oniosFeatureTests/lfm2oniosFeatureTests.swift` - Unit tests

### Architecture Overview for New Engineers
```
User Interaction Flow:
1. ContentView determines if model is selected
2. If not selected ‚Üí ModelSelectionView (first run) or SettingsView
3. If selected ‚Üí ChatView with loaded model
4. ChatView uses ModelRuntimeService (actor) for thread-safe inference
5. All services use modern Swift Concurrency (async/await, no callbacks)
```

### Common Development Tasks
- **Add new model**: Update `ModelCatalog.swift` with model metadata
- **Modify UI**: Edit SwiftUI files in `lfm2oniosPackage/Sources/lfm2oniosFeature/`
- **Add dependencies**: Edit `lfm2oniosPackage/Package.swift`
- **Logging**: Use print statements with structured JSON format (see existing examples)
- **Testing**: Add tests to `lfm2oniosFeatureTests.swift` using Swift Testing framework

## Development Notes

### Code Organization
Most development happens in `lfm2oniosPackage/Sources/lfm2oniosFeature/` - organize your code as you prefer.

### Public API Requirements
Types exposed to the app target need `public` access:
```swift
public struct NewView: View {
    public init() {}
    
    public var body: some View {
        // Your view code
    }
}
```

### Adding Dependencies
Edit `lfm2oniosPackage/Package.swift` to add SPM dependencies:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/example/SomePackage", from: "1.0.0")
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "lfm2oniosFeature",
        dependencies: ["SomePackage"]
    ),
]
```

## Project-Specific Implementation Details

### LLM Integration (Leap SDK)
This app integrates with [Liquid AI's Leap SDK](https://leap.liquid.ai/) for on-device LLM inference:

- **SDK**: LeapSDK v0.5.0+ via Swift Package Manager
- **Models**: LFM2 family models (350M, 700M, 1.2B parameters)
- **Download**: Uses `LeapModelDownloader` for on-demand model downloads
- **Inference**: Streaming chat responses via `Conversation.generateResponse`

### Key Services

#### Core Service Architecture
- `ModelCatalog`: Static catalog of available LFM2 models with metadata
- `ModelDownloadService`: Handles model downloads with progress tracking
- `ModelStorageService`: Manages downloaded model files and storage detection  
- `ModelRuntimeService`: Loads models and handles inference with LeapSDK
- `PersistenceService`: Saves/loads selected model preferences

#### Service Integration Patterns
- **Actor-Based Concurrency**: `ModelRuntimeService` uses actor pattern for thread-safe model operations
- **Async/Await**: All services use modern Swift Concurrency (no completion handlers)
- **Dependency Injection**: Services passed as parameters, not singleton globals
- **State Management**: SwiftUI `@State` and `@Observable` for reactive UI updates
- **Safe Model Lifecycle**: `unloadModel()` ensures proper cleanup during model switches

### Bundle Format Support
The app supports both directory and ZIP-based model bundles:
- **Directory bundles**: Traditional `.bundle` folders with model files
- **ZIP bundles**: Compressed `.bundle` files downloaded by LeapModelDownloader
- Storage and runtime services automatically detect and handle both formats

### Download Progress Implementation
Progress tracking uses LeapModelDownloader's polling API:
```swift
// Start download
downloader.requestDownloadModel(model)

// Poll for progress
let status = await downloader.queryStatus(model)
switch status {
case .downloadInProgress(let progress):
    updateProgressUI(progress) // 0.0 to 1.0
case .downloaded:
    // Download complete
}
```

### Model Storage
- **Location**: `Application Support/Models/`  
- **Format**: `{quantization-slug}.bundle` (e.g., `lfm2-350m-20250710-8da4w.bundle`)
- **Size**: Models range from ~320MB (350M) to ~920MB (1.2B)
- **Detection**: Handles both file and directory bundles transparently

### Performance Characteristics
- **Model Load Time**: ~0.33 seconds (LFM2-350M)
- **Inference Speed**: ~127 tokens/second (iPhone simulator)
- **Memory**: Models use ~300-900MB depending on size
- **Context Window**: 4,096 tokens for all LFM2 models

### Development Status & Quality

#### Current Status: Production Ready (Phase 7 Complete)
As of August 2025, this project has completed all planned development phases:

‚úÖ **Phase 1-6**: Core functionality, model management, download system, runtime integration, UI polish  
‚úÖ **Phase 7**: Production hardening, comprehensive testing, accessibility, structured logging

#### Quality Metrics
- **Build Status**: Zero warnings, clean codebase
- **Test Coverage**: 9/9 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Architecture**: Modern Swift 6 concurrency, @Observable patterns, actor-based services
- **Accessibility**: Full VoiceOver support, proper accessibility labels
- **Logging**: Centralized structured logging with consistent JSON formatting

### Error Handling
Common issues and solutions:
- **Download stuck at 0%**: Fixed by using `requestDownloadModel()` + polling
- **Model load failures**: Ensure ZIP bundle support in storage/runtime services  
- **Network failures**: Download service includes retry logic
- **Storage issues**: App checks available space before downloads

### UI Architecture & Navigation

#### Current UI Flow (Phase 6)
The app uses a simplified, card-based interface for model management:

1. **Chat View**: Shows current model name in navigation bar with new conversation (+) and settings (‚öôÔ∏è) buttons
2. **Settings View**: Displays all models as cards with inline actions - no complex navigation flows
3. **Model Cards**: Each card shows model info with contextual buttons based on state

#### Settings UI Design Pattern
- **Visual Selection**: Selected model has blue background/border (no redundant text labels)
- **Icon-Based Actions**: SF Symbols for all actions (download ‚¨áÔ∏è, select ‚úì, delete üóëÔ∏è)
- **State-Aware UI**: Buttons change based on model state (not downloaded ‚Üí downloaded ‚Üí selected)
- **Immediate Feedback**: Model switching happens instantly with automatic settings dismissal

#### Key UI Components
- `ContentView`: Root navigation and model state management
- `ChatView`: Conversation interface with model indicator and toolbar
- `SettingsView`: Simplified card-based model management
- `ModelCardView`: Individual model card with state-aware actions
- `ModelSelectionView`: First-run model selection (legacy, used for initial setup)

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: `lfm2oniosPackage/Tests/lfm2oniosFeatureTests/` (Swift Testing framework)
- **UI Tests**: `lfm2oniosUITests/` (XCUITest framework)
- **Test Plan**: `lfm2onios.xctestplan` coordinates all tests

## Configuration

### XCConfig Build Settings
Build settings are managed through **XCConfig files** in `Config/`:
- `Config/Shared.xcconfig` - Common settings (bundle ID, versions, deployment target)
- `Config/Debug.xcconfig` - Debug-specific settings  
- `Config/Release.xcconfig` - Release-specific settings
- `Config/Tests.xcconfig` - Test-specific settings

### Entitlements Management
App capabilities are managed through a **declarative entitlements file**:
- `Config/lfm2onios.entitlements` - All app entitlements and capabilities
- AI agents can safely edit this XML file to add HealthKit, CloudKit, Push Notifications, etc.
- No need to modify complex Xcode project files

### Asset Management
- **App-Level Assets**: `lfm2onios/Assets.xcassets/` (app icon, accent color)
- **Feature Assets**: Add `Resources/` folder to SPM package if needed

### SPM Package Resources
To include assets in your feature package:
```swift
.target(
    name: "lfm2oniosFeature",
    dependencies: [],
    resources: [.process("Resources")]
)
```
